Content blocks are defined by the [[Widgets]] definition that is selected. Predefined Shared Widgets can be used by multiple blocks within multiple pages, but the shared content is the same.    [[Widgets]] can also be generated on the fly from the block and will not  be  stored as shareable.  These widgets can be saved as shareable.  Content blocks are sortable and movable between zones in a single layout.  The default definition of a content block is [[Basic HTML]]

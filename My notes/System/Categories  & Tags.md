## Globally defined tags
The tag system will be defined at the global level
Creation of a tag  or definition of the tag depending on the type may be done at the event level.  

### Established tag structure 
- Global only mutation 
	- Faculty Role 
	- Credits
	- Primary learning pathway
- Event mutation  
	- Award Level Definition 
	- Learning pathway children and grandchildren creation
	- Channel created at event
- 
### Multi tiered tag construction 

**Major concerns cross event compatibility** 

Events depending on the science explore different levels of the science but multi level tags allow search to find children when searching of parent terms.   

- Parent tag
	- Children
		- Grandchildren

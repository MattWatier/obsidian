Collections are any set of [[Structured Data Items]].    Certain collections are directly paired with widgets which render UI or power certain functionality.  

Most collections are basic with [[System establishing data]] but collections may have data manipulations applied to them like  and sort and [[Categories  & Tags]]

[[Channels]] are a variation of collections that have an advanced level of data manipulation to construct agendas.

## Individual vs shareable widget 
Individual Widgets have the function to save its saved state and content to a central definition which then can be referenced in multiple locations on the site.  This item is then referred to and all changes to its configuration are the same throughout the event

Content blocks can load any shareable  widget.  

A shareable widget can break its central reference which at that point it will clone information from the shareable widget definition and will  establish itself as a newly defined individual widget .  


### Content and Data [[Collections]]
Depending on the widgets structure there are design and function configurations.  Some widgets establish a pattern of data input that could be a simple as text and as complicated as a data collection.
